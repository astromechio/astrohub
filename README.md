# AstroHub

AstroHub is an in-memory request-response multiplexer for [micro]service oriented applications

## Description

AstroHub is a service meant to sit between your "level 1" API servers or load balancers and your microservices. It allows services to communicate with one another through a centralized hub. This is the first in a set of Astro tools for building service oriented applications.

## Details

AstroHub is written in Go, and leverages all of Go's robust realtime features to create a performant, low latency message bus.

AstroHub enables interaction with a microservice with a single request/response cycle. Microservices can interact with AstroHub using HTTP REST, or gRPC (coming soon). The Astro* spec will allow microservices to be deployed without and port requirements, ensuring easy deployments and no need for any centralized service discovery. The Astro* spec is still being designed, but the current iteration looks like so:

[Load Balancer] <--> [AstroServer(s)] <--> [AstroHub] <--> [Astro* Services]

## Documentation

#### Endpoints:
	* Queue up a "job" and recieve a response:
		`POST: /service/{name}`

		* Request:
			* {name} should be the name of the service you would like a response from
			* The request body should be an encoded JSON string.
				* Note: AstroHub will have no knowledge of the request body, it will just pass along the encoded JSON. It is the responsibility of the receiving service to decode the data.

		*Response:
			* Response body will consist of a JSON encoded response from the target service.

	* Get the next available "job" for a particular service:
		`GET: /service/{name}/jobs`

		* Request:
			* {name} should be the name of the service who's job you would like to process.

		* Response:
			* A JSON encoded representation of the job to br processed:
			`{"id": [unique-uuid-v4 string], "originalRequest": [encoded JSON of original request]}`
				* Note that the `id` will be used to post a response, so save it.
	
	* Send a response to a job:
		`POST: /jobs/{id}`

		* Request:
			* {id} should be the id of the job you recieved using `/service/{name}/jobs`.
			* The request body should be a JSON encoded string of your response data.
		* Response:
			* You will recieve an empty status 200 OK response when your response was sent successfully, or an appropriate HTTP error code if there was an error.

#### Notes:
	* Requests to `/service/{name}/jobs` can be long-lasting if no jobs are currently queued up. It may be smart to set timeouts on these requests and retry as appropriate. Astro* libraries will handle this automatically in the future. gRPC will also alleviate this issue.

	* In the future, we will be providing an `astro-go` library (and possibly others) which will mimic the standard `net/http` http server, and will be compatible with AstroHub

	* AstroHub is of course still in early development, so don't use it for anything important yet!
		

## Coming soon:
	* gRPC support for hub <--> service communication
		* client <--> hub communication will always be HTTP REST
	* Docker image for easy deployment
	* Authentication
	* .Astrofile support (spec coming soon as well)
